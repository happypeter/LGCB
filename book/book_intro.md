### Why this book?    

Now I am getting a lot of requests from my students that they need a textbook,
that's why I want to write this one. I need a book that covers all that I want to
share with my students, no more and no less.

There is a book named [The Linux Command
Line](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php), which is really nice, but it
is too difficult for my students. Truth is that I copied a lot of stuff from
this book to LGCB, and removed all its difficult vocabularies.  

Still if you want a extended reading, _The Linux Command Line_ is the first
one I'll recommend. You can get it by a simple googling.


### This book is for Chinese people
As a Chinese, I know my fellow citizens generally do not speak English well, but
I do believe that no matter what your birth tongue is, as long as you want to
learn Linux, you should use English as your language for work. Otherwise you
are on the wrong track. Learning materials in Chinese are so hard to find, and
the translations are usually very bad.

There are surely some beginner's guides on web, but most Chinese people still
feel frustrated reading. So here this book will fill this gap, and it will
serve as a guide to those guides, written in really easy English(slightly
broken, sorry), giving a new tech term only when very necessary, and it will
be explained the way that makes non-native English speakers feel comfortable. 

### The book is for absolute beginners
If you already have several years of experience, this book might be too easy
for you. My goals doing this book are:

 - as easy as possible 
 - as interesting as possible

I will try to concentrate only on things that are important for beginners,
keep it simple and stupid. While at the same time avoid making this book
loaded with nothing but quick and dirty tricks. Attention is paid to show the
readers the whole picture, and teach them to do things the right way, so that
they can feel natural in their next step learning.

### What's in this book
It is really all about how to survive in the new world of Linux. It is not
about something hard, but rather about helping you out when you are lost in
the vast ocean of Linux knowledge. 

Note that this book is very __ubuntu__-centric. There are many kinds of Linux
(_distros_ to be precise), __ubuntu__ is now the most popular one . Playing with
only one distro can effectively avoid talking about dark corners, add the
possibility to do things right and build confidence.

### How to read this book
I think the right way to learn Linux is pretty much like learning a foreign
language. You do not learn one thing in full detail, and then move to
another.(that's why usually it is not wise to learn chapter by chapter), but
that you learn basic vocabulary of all necessary fields(very basic things about
bash, vim...) and then try to talk to sb(your computer). Of course, you will
soon find out your knowledge is limited, then you will be happy to go back to
your textbooks to learn things that look interesting to you.(and again, you
may still leave more complicated thing along). Anyway, you know what I mean,
learning by doing, keep it simple and let it grow.

But as to this book, I will try to keep things really easy, and make it 
possible to finish each part in one go without frustrations.  And the above
rules may still fit for the more advanced books that I will bring to you in
this book. But this book is just the "basic vocabulary of all necessary
fields".

You can just start at the beginning of the book and follow it to the end. It
isn't written as a reference work, it's really more like a story with a
beginning, middle, and an end.
