title: C Introduction
---

Back in 2002, when I was in college and given a course on C, I failed because
I hated it. That is:

    - C was hard to learn
    - I did not know how it could be of any dame use!

So, OK, now is the year of 2011, I am trying to teach other people to use C,
God bless!

I want to go LGCB story-telling style and try to make this lanaguage easy
to learn, and make people understand that C is useful.

## Learn C the easy way

In most C books, you get a whole chapter on one single topic, say _data type_.
Now you get whole lot of details about this. I won't say this is wrong, since
this might be the only way to do a serious book. But I want to say, beginners
ususally can't tell what is the most important part. So they learn it
"systematically", and no long later forget everything "systematically". 

For me it is better only to show the students _int_ and _char_, so that they
they can 

    - do real code right now
    - only to learn what is "float" when they need to

This is what I called the easy way, so LGCB won't be a "serious book". It
will just behave like a good friend showing you something cool about C, from
easy to the difficult, step by step, because he knows otherwise you will kick
him on the ass.

## Usefulness Brings Interests

If somebody wants me to learn what a "C function" is, he first needs to show me
why function is cool, and makes what I want to do a lot easier(rather than make
it more painful:). Because I started the easy way, and now already done some
lines of code, so just show me with my OWN code!! 

So learning by doing, learn a new C feature when you feel the real need in
your project. When enough interest are gathered, you are willing to learn
more, becaue all what you learn bring elegance(not trouble) to your projects.
you are alreay a good programmer, even though you still don't know float and
double yet:-)
